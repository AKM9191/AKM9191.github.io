    <h3 align="left">Early life and education</h3>
    <p> He attended the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later the Seeds Elementary School, before enrolling at the John Marshall High School. DiCaprio later said that he had hated public school and wanted to audition for acting jobs instead, so that he could improve his family's financial situation.He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning a general equivalency diploma.</p>
    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>DiCaprio made his film debut later that year as the stepson of an unscrupulous landlord in the low-budget horror Critters 3 (1991), a role he later described as "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair".DiCaprio has stated that he prefers not to remember Critters 3, describing it as "possibly one of the worst films of all time", and citing it as the kind of role he wanted to ignore in the future.Later in 1991, he became a recurring cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by a family.Co-star Joanna Kerns recalls DiCaprio being "especially intelligent and disarming for his age" but she said that he was also mischievous and jocular on set and often made fun of his co-stars.DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to young female audiences but his arrival did not improve the show's ratings and he left before the end of its run, attributing his departure to bad writing.He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.

        Lasse Hallström directed DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), for which he earned his first Academy Award nomination
        In 1992, DiCaprio played a brief role in the first installment of the Poison Ivy film series,and later in the year Robert De Niro handpicked DiCaprio from a shortlist of 400 young actors to co-star with him in This Boy's Life. The film is a biopic on the relationship between the rebellious teenager Tobias "Toby" Wolff (DiCaprio) and his mother (Ellen Barkin) and abusive stepfather (De Niro).Its director Michael Caton-Jones later said that DiCaprio did not know how to behave on set, leading Caton-Jones to apply a strict mentoring style, after which DiCaprio's behavior began to improve.Bilge Ebiri of Rolling Stone found that the powerful bond between Barkin and DiCaprio elevated the film, praising DiCaprio's portrayal of the character's complex growth from a rebellious teenager to an independent young man.
